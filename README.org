* INTRODUCTION

  Learning Emacs will reward me with knowledge of a powerful
  cross-platform and general-purpose tool. I plan to learn Emacs by
  following Avdi Grimm's example in his "Emacs Reboot" series. Namely,
  to set-up Emacs 24 from scratch as a learning exercise. 

** PLAN

   For each of the following, study the changes made and incorporate
   those that seem most relevant and useful.

   1) Emacs Reboot
   2) Emacs Prelude
   3) Emacs24 Starter Kit
   4) Ergoemacs
   5) Xah Lee's Emacs Tutorial

* SUMMARY

  Keep all emacs configuation in a single directory. Put that
  directory under version control, and push it to Github.
