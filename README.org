* INTRODUCTION

  Learning Emacs will reward me with knowledge of a powerful
  cross-platform and general-purpose tool. I plan to learn Emacs by
  following Avdi Grimm's example in his "Emacs Reboot" series. Namely,
  to set-up Emacs 24 from scratch as a learning exercise. 

** PLAN

   For each of the following, study the changes made and incorporate
   those that seem most relevant and useful.

   1) Emacs Reboot
   2) Emacs Prelude
   3) Emacs24 Starter Kit
   4) Xah Lee's Emacs Tutorial and his Ergoemacs
   5) Kurt Schwehr's Research Tools
   
* SUMMARY

  Keep all emacs configuation in a single directory. Put that
  directory under version control, and push it to Github.  

* TODO Emacs Reboot
** DONE [[http://avdi.org/devblog/2011/08/08/emacs-reboot-1-beginnings/][Emacs Reboot #1: Beginnings]], Part 1
   Check out Emacs 24 from bzr and build it from source.
   - DECLINED
     I use a PPA for Emacs 24 from Batsov's Emacs Prelude.
** DONE [[http://avdi.org/devblog/2011/08/08/emacs-reboot-1-beginnings/][Emacs Reboot #1: Beginnings]], Part 2

     I installed the various development libraries needed to build
     Emacs 24.
#+begin_src sh

#+end_src
** DONE [[http://avdi.org/devblog/2011/08/09/emacs-reboot-2-startup/][Emacs Reboot #2: Startup]]
   Test the emacs newly built from source, and force it to load a
   different init file
   - DECLINED
     I installed Emacs 24 from a package manager.
#+begin_src sh
sudo apt-get install libcanberra-gtk3-dev
#+end_src
** DONE [[http://avdi.org/devblog/2011/09/08/emacs-reboot-3-preparing-the-canvas/][Emacs Reboot #3: Preparing the Canvas]], Part 1
   Set .emacs to switch between Emacs 23 and Emacs 24 depending on
   which version of Emacs one starts.
   - DECLINED
     I don't plan to keep multiple versions of emacs installed.
** DONE [[http://avdi.org/devblog/2011/09/08/emacs-reboot-3-preparing-the-canvas/][Emacs Reboot #3: Preparing the Canvas]], Part 1
   Combine all configuration in a single version-controlled directory
   and push that to Github.
   - ACCEPTED
     See [[https://github.com/JayDugger/.emacs.d][JayDugger/.emacs.d]] on GitHub.     
** DONE [[http://avdi.org/devblog/2011/09/08/emacs-reboot-4-customizing-customization/][Emacs Reboot #4: Customizing Customization]] 
   Set emacs to use ~/.emacs24.d/emacs-customizations.el.
   - DECLINED
     I don't plan to keep multiple versions of emacs installed.
** DONE [[http://avdi.org/devblog/2011/09/10/emacs-reboot-5/][Emacs Reboot #5]]
   Move back-up file copies from their default location alongside the
   original file to a single central directory at ~/.emacs.d/backups.
   - DECLINED
     Creating a central back-up directory doesn't offer my any advantages.
** TODO [[http://avdi.org/devblog/2011/09/19/emacs-reboot-6-marmalade-magit/][Emacs Reboot #6: Marmalade, Magit]]
   I use the Maramalade package archive to install the latest and
   greatest Magit-mode for managing Git repositories.
